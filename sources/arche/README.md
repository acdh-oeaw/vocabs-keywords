# Clean-up workflow for ARCHE keywords

## 1. Check language tag

The result of the following two actions is stored in `edited/arche_keywords_edit_1_lang.csv`.

### 1.1 Include a language tag where this is missing

If a term has **no** language tag in the `lang` column, **a language tag is added** to the `correct_lang` column.

The language tag `und` is assigned to **proper names** of places and persons. In this case, the note `proper name` is added to the `notes_lang` column.

If the name of an **organization** or a **product** (_e.g._, a newspaper) is clearly in a certain language, such as `Austrian Press Agency` and `Berliner Tageblatt`, then the appropriate language tag is assigned. Otherwise, the language tag `und` is assigned, just as for proper names of places and persons.

The language tag `und` is also assigned to **abbreviations used in/suitable for multiple languages** (_e.g._, `TLS` = `terrestrial laser scanning` [English] / `terrestriches Laserscanning` [German]). The language tag `und` is also assigned when an abbreviation comes from words in multiple languages, such as `CIDOC CRM` (= `Comit√© International pour la Documentation` [French] + `Conceptual Reference Model` [English]). In the case of an abbreviation, the term `abbreviation` is also added to the `notes_lang` column.

A special case is represented by the numerous abbreviations coming from the [Downed Allied Air Crew Database Austria](https://hdl.handle.net/21.11115/0000-000D-CA69-A) dataset. These are assigned the language tag `und` and the note `DAACDA` is added to the `notes_lang` column, so that they can be easily excluded from future analyses if desired.

In some cases, it is **ambiguous** to which language a term belongs (for example, `Edition`, which might be English or German). In these cases, it is examined in which context the term appears: _e.g._, if the term is always used along other terms in German when describing resources in ARCHE, then it is assumed that this term too is in German.

### 1.2 Correct existing language tags

If a term has a wrong language tag in the `lang` column, **the correct language tag is assigned** in the `correct_lang` column.
