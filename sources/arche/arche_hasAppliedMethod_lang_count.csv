"VOICE, the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English, is a one-million-word corpus of naturally-occurring, non-scripted, face-to-face interactions carried out using English as a lingua franca (ELF), i.e. English used as a common means of communication among speakers from different first-language backgrounds. The interactions recorded and transcribed are complete speech events from different domains (educational, leisure, professional) and represent different speech event types (conversation, interview, meeting, panel, press conference, question-answer session, seminar discussion, service encounter, working group discussion, workshop discussion).",en,7
